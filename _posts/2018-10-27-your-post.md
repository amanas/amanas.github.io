## State of The Art

When you start a research, tipically the first step is to review the "State of The Art".

Benefits:

* it demonstrates the novelty of your research results
* you learn about your research problem
* it shows different approaches to a solution
* you can reuse from what others have done

Currently, I am starting to write my MSc. Thesis. The research is about forecasting the flow traffic in the city of Madrid. In order to elaborate the SoTA, I have proceed as follows.


### Search related terms

Choose many search terms and find related publications on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.es/). The list of terms used was:

* traffic forecasting 
* traffic forecast model comparison 
* traffic forecasting machine learning 
* traffic forecasting time series models 
* traffic prediction models (filtering from 2014) 
* traffic forecast multivariate (filtering from desde 2014) 
* traffic forecasting artificial intelligence 
* traffic forecasting neural networks models 

For each result, choose 10 results (those that most attract you) and put all of them into a single csv document. Do not worry if some are picked several times:

```{r, echo=F}
library(knitr)

find.file <- function(fname) {
  for (p in c('data/', '../data/', paste0(getwd(),'/../data/')))
    if (file.exists(paste0(p, fname)))
      return(normalizePath(paste0(p, fname)))
}
data <- read.csv(find.file('SoTA.csv'), header = T, sep = ';')
kable(head(data))
```

Now we can sort by year, cited and times we selected it:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
library(dplyr)

data %>%
  group_by(url) %>%
  summarise(freq = length(url), title = first(title),
            year = first(year), cited = first(cited)) %>%
  arrange(desc(freq), desc(year), desc(cited)) %>%
  select(title, year, cited, freq) %>%  head(10) %>%
  kable(format = "html")
```
