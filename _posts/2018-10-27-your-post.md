State of The Art
================

When you start a research, tipically the first step is to review the **"State of The Art"**.

Benefits
--------

-   it demonstrates the novelty of your research results
-   you learn about your research problem
-   it shows different approaches to a solution
-   you can reuse from what others have done

Currently, I am starting to write my MSc. Thesis. The research is about forecasting the flow traffic in the city of Madrid. In order to elaborate the SoTA, I have proceed as follows.

Step 1: search related terms
----------------------------

Choose many search terms and find related publications on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.es/). The list of terms used was:

-   traffic forecasting
-   traffic forecast model comparison
-   traffic forecasting machine learning
-   traffic forecasting time series models
-   traffic prediction models (filtering from 2014)
-   traffic forecast multivariate (filtering from desde 2014)
-   traffic forecasting artificial intelligence
-   traffic forecasting neural networks models

For each result, choose 10 results (those that most attract you) and put all of them into a single csv document. Do not worry if some are picked several times:

``` r
suppressWarnings(library('dplyr'))
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)

find.file <- function(fname) {
  for (p in c('data/', '../data/', paste0(getwd(),'/../data/')))
    if (file.exists(paste0(p, fname)))
      return(normalizePath(paste0(p, fname)))
}

data <- read.csv(find.file('SoTA.csv'), header = T, sep = ';')
data %>%
  mutate(title = paste0(substr(title,1,40), '...')) %>%
  mutate(url = paste0(substr(url,1,20), '...')) %>%
  select(title, url, year, cited) %>% head()%>% kable()
```

| title                                       | url                       |  year|  cited|

| Traffic flow prediction with big data: A... | <https://ieeexplore.i>... |  2015|    562|

Step 2: arrange
---------------

Now we can sort by year, cited and times we selected it:

``` r
data.sum <- data %>%
  group_by(url) %>%
  summarise(freq = length(url), title = first(title), 
            URL = first(url), year = first(year), 
            cited = first(cited)) %>%
  mutate(url = URL) %>%
  mutate(title = paste0(substr(title,1,50), '...')) %>%
  arrange(desc(freq), desc(year), desc(cited)) 
  
data.sum %>% select(title, year, cited, freq) %>% head %>% kable
```

| title                                                 |  year|  cited|  freq|

> Sort according to your own criteria. It could be interesting to select recent stuff, cited many times.

### Step 2: weight

We can even add a weight:

``` r
data.sum %>%
  mutate(W = (cited + (2018 - year)) * freq) %>% 
  select(title, year, cited, freq, W) %>%
  mutate(title = paste0(substr(title,1,50), '...')) %>%
  arrange(desc(W)) %>% kable
```

| title                                                 |  year|  cited|  freq|     W|
