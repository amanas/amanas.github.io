## State of The Art

When you start a research, tipically the first step is to review the "State of The Art".

Benefits:

-   it demonstrates the novelty of your research results
-   you learn about your research problem
-   it shows different approaches to a solution
-   you can reuse from what others have done

Currently, I am starting to write my MSc. Thesis. The research is about forecasting the flow traffic in the city of Madrid. In order to elaborate the SoTA, I have proceed as follows.

### Search related terms

Choose many search terms and find related publications on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.es/). The list of terms used was:

-   traffic forecasting
-   traffic forecast model comparison
-   traffic forecasting machine learning
-   traffic forecasting time series models
-   traffic prediction models (filtering from 2014)
-   traffic forecast multivariate (filtering from desde 2014)
-   traffic forecasting artificial intelligence
-   traffic forecasting neural networks models

For each result, choose 10 results (those that most attract you) and put all of them into a single csv document. Do not worry if some are picked several times:

Now we can sort by year, cited and times we selected it:

``` r
library(dplyr)

data %>%
  group_by(url) %>%
  summarise(freq = length(url), title = first(title),
            year = first(year), cited = first(cited)) %>%
  arrange(desc(freq), desc(year), desc(cited)) %>%
  select(title, year, cited, freq) %>%  head(10) %>%
  kable()
```
