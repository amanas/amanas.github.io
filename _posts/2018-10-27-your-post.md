# State of The Art

When you start a research, tipically the first step is to review the **"State of The Art"**.

## Benefits

* it demonstrates the novelty of your research results
* you learn about your research problem
* it shows different approaches to a solution
* you can reuse from what others have done

Currently, I am starting to write my MSc. Thesis. The research is about forecasting the flow traffic in the city of Madrid. In order to elaborate the SoTA, I have proceed as follows.


## Step 1: search related terms

Choose many search terms and find related publications on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.es/). The list of terms used was:

* traffic forecasting 
* traffic forecast model comparison 
* traffic forecasting machine learning 
* traffic forecasting time series models 
* traffic prediction models (filtering from 2014) 
* traffic forecast multivariate (filtering from desde 2014) 
* traffic forecasting artificial intelligence 
* traffic forecasting neural networks models 

For each result, choose 10 results (those that most attract you) and put all of them into a single csv document. Do not worry if some are picked several times:


```R
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)

data %>%
  mutate(title = paste0(substr(title,1,40), '...')) %>%
  mutate(url = paste0(substr(url,1,20), '...')) %>%
  select(title, url, year, cited) %>% head()%>% kable()
```


    
    
    |title                                       |url                     | year| cited|

## Step 2: arrange

Now we can sort by year, cited and times we selected it:



```R
data.sum <- data %>%
  group_by(url) %>%
  summarise(freq = length(url), title = first(title), 
            URL = first(url), year = first(year), 
            cited = first(cited)) %>%
  mutate(url = URL) %>%
  mutate(title = paste0(substr(title,1,60), '...')) %>%
  arrange(desc(freq), desc(year), desc(cited)) 
  
data.sum %>% select(title, year, cited, freq) %>% head %>% kable
```


    
    
    |title                                                           | year| cited| freq|

> Sort according to your own criteria. It could be interesting to select recent stuff, cited many times.


### Step 2: weight

We can even add a weight:


```R
data.sum %>%
  mutate(W = (cited + (2018 - year)) * freq) %>% 
  select(title, year, cited, freq, W) %>%
  mutate(title = paste0(substr(title,1,60), '...')) %>%
  arrange(desc(W)) %>% kable
```


    
    
    |title                                                           | year| cited| freq|    W|
